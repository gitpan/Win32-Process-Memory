  # do debug
  printf "\nTotal Memory = 0x%X\n", $proc->get_memtotal;
  print "\nMemory block list:\n";
  my %memlist = $proc->get_memlist;
  printf "  %08X -> %08X : Len=0x%X\n", $_, $_+$memlist{$_}, $memlist{$_}
      foreach (sort {$a <=> $b} keys %memlist);
  print "\nContent of 0x10004 -> 0x10103\n";
  print $proc->hexdump(0x10004, 0x100);

  # search a sequence of unsigned int16
  print "\nFind a sequence of unsinged int16:\n";
  my @results = $proc->search_u16(92, 87, 105, 110, 51, 50);
  print $proc->hexdump($_, 0x32)."\n" foreach @results;

  # read and change value
  printf "\n0x%X [unsigned int16] : %d\n", 0x10004, $proc->get_u16(0x10004);
  printf "0x%X [unsigned int32] : %d\n", 0x10004, $proc->get_u32(0x10004);
